# Leaf Grow

A visualisation on leaf grow

## Prerequisites:

I use a virtual environment which is explained in the next heading. But you can also install everything manually. 

- python 3.6

## Create a virtual env

This will create a virtualenv with the python3.6 version and starts it directly.

    mkvirtualenv LeafGrow --python=python3.6
