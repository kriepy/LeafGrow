# Leaf Grow

A visualisation on leaf grow

## Quickstart
Install the dependencies with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the program with

    python main

## Prerequisites:

I use a virtual environment which is explained in the following [heading](#create-a-virtual-env). But you can also install everything manually. 

- python 3.6

Add new dependencies with

    pip freeze > requirements.txt


## Create a virtual env

This will create a virtualenv with the python3.6 version and starts it directly.

    mkvirtualenv LeafGrow --python=python3.6

Start the env with

    workon LeafGrow
